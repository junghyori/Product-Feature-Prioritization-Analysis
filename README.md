# Product-Feature-Prioritization-Analysis

This repository is part of an ongoing thesis project that delves into conducting a feature prioritization analysis of Disneyland based on visitor reviews sourced from the TripAdvisor platform.

## Jupyter Notebook
The provided Jupyter notebook is systematically organized into three main sections:

### 1. Text Preprocessing
Within this section, the data undergoes various preprocessing steps, which include tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and other text-cleaning procedures, thereby preparing the data for deeper analysis.

### 2. Feature Extraction
Here, several Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques including topic modelling and POS tagging are employed to discern and extract salient features from the visitor reviews. These features encapsulate diverse facets of the Disneyland experience, echoing the sentiments and observations voiced by the visitors.

### 3. Priority Analysis
Post-feature extraction, the third section is dedicated to the analysis and prioritization of these features. Their significance is ascertained based on criteria like relevance, frequency, and sentiment scores. This rigorous analysis aids in spotlighting the most pivotal features that could serve as focal points for enhancing the Disneyland visitor experience.
